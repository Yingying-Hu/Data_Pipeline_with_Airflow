# Udaicty Data Engineering Project: Data Pipelines with Airflow 
## Bussiness Problem and Usage
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

They have decided to bring you into the project and expect you to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

**The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift**. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

## Project Datasets
You'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:


Song data: ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data```  
Log data: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data```

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
``` 
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```ruby
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Environment Setup
### [Redshift](environment_setup/create_redshift_cluster.ipynb)
1. **Create an IAM role** that will be attached to the Redshift cluster to enable your cluster to load data from Amazon S3 buckets
2. **Create a security group** for authorizing access to the Redshift cluster 
    > A security group will act as firewall rules for your Redshift cluster to control inbound and outbound traffic.
3. **Launch a Redshift Cluster**
4. **create an IAM user** that will be used to access your Redshift cluster.

### [Add Airflow Connections](environment_setup/airflow_connections_instruction.md)
Use Airflow's UI to configure your AWS credentials and connection to Redshift.  

## Detailed Steps for building the Data Pipeline on Apache Airflow
### Configuring the DAG
The requirement includes:
* The DAG does not have dependencies on past runs
* On failure, the task are retried 3 times
* Retries happen every 5 minutes
* Catchup is turned off
* Do not email on retry

### Building the Operators 
 The graph view for the data pipeline DAG is:

* **Create Dataset and Load Source Data**  
As the name suggested, the create table operator creates datastes in the Redshift cluster using SQL CREATE TABLE statement. Then, stage operator is expected to be able to **load any JSON formatted files from S3 to the Redshift tables**. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. 
  
    
* **Data Modeling**  
  1. Fact Table
        *  **songplays** â€” records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page ```NextSong```       
            *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*                    
           
  2. Dimension Tables 
        * **songs** - songs in music database  
            *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
        * **users** - users in the app  
            *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
        * **artists** - artists in music database  
            *artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude*
        * **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units  
            *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

* **Data Quality**   
The final operator to create is the data quality operator, which is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each the test, the test result and expected result needs to be checked and if there is no match, the operator should raise an exception and the task should retry and fail eventually.
